# guessing-game 

Purely awesome, yet random, piece of code written in pure Python.  

Guess a secret number between 1 and 1000 while the computer roasts your bad guesses.


## Features
- Random secret number (1–1000)
- Recieve savage taunts for wrong guesses
- Screen clearing for clean terminal experience

- Press Enter to exit when you win
